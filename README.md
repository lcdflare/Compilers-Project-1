A simple JavaCC lexical analyzer written as a project for CS4110
Included below is a brief project description and steps for compiling and running the code

/***********************************************************************************
* Collaborators: Prado, Arden & Francisco Rodriguez
* Project: 1
* Due: 10/04/2018
* Course: cs-4110-01
*
* Description:
* A simple lexical analyzer for a fictional object-oriented language named 'Toy.'
* The goal of this project is to scan any Toy-related programming files and translate
* the code into a sequence of tokens that can then be stored and modified using a
* symbol table of the data structure trie.
*
*
* Instructions for Running:
* The program can be compiled from command line or terminal using the command "javac *.java"
* This will compile all java files in the source. This step can also be skipped if using the 
* .class files provided. To run the program, type "java -cp [PATH] compilers_project_1.MyNewGrammar [FILENAME]"
* Where [PATH] specifies the install path to the compilers_project_1 package, and [FILENAME] specifies the file to be parsed.
* Included in the program are two test files: "toy.txt" and "toy2.txt"
